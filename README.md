Madlib-Generator Application
Mad Libs generator application that I built using Python and Tkinter. 
Mad Libs are those fun games where you fill in the blanks with different types of words, and the result is often hilarious.

How to execute - Type python MadlibGenerator_Application.py in Terminal and press ENTER.
